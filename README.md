# Next Word Prediction

This project implements a **Next Word Prediction** model using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The primary goal of this project is to predict the next word in a sentence based on a given input sequence, leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning models.

## Features
- Predicts the most probable next word for a given sequence of text.
- Preprocessed text data for tokenization and model training.
- Utilizes deep learning architecture for accurate predictions.
- Visualizes model performance through loss and accuracy graphs.

## Libraries Used
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the neural network model.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **NLTK/Spacy**: For text preprocessing and tokenization.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/next-word-prediction.git
