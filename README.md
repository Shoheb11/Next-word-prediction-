README for Next Word Prediction Project
Project Overview
This repository contains a Next Word Prediction project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. The model is designed to predict the most likely next word based on a given input text, using Python and its powerful libraries. This project demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be combined with machine learning to create intelligent text completion systems.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, padding, and vocabulary creation.
Model Architecture: Utilizes a deep learning-based model (LSTM or similar) for sequential word prediction.
Interactive Predictions: Allows users to input text and get real-time word predictions.
Visualization: Graphs and metrics to evaluate model performance.
